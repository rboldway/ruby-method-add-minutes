Code Challenge
Write a function or method that accepts two mandatory arguments and returns a result.
Requirements:
Use Ruby or another language of your choosing, and write production quality code.
Your function or method should not use any date/time library.
The first argument is a time value in the form of a string with the following

 format:

[H]H:MM {AM|PM}


The second argument is the number of minutes, as an integer value.
The return value of the function should be a string of the same format as the first
argument, which is a result of adding the minutes to the time.


For example
would return

add_minutes('9:13 AM', 10)
9:23 AM
